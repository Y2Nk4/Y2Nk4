<hr>

Hi, I am an enthusiast with expertise in Computer Networks, Distributed Systems, Computer Algorithms, Machine Learning and full-stack development. I am interested in building infrastructures that drive large-scale applications.

During the summer of 2023, I had a wonderful time serving as a Software Engineer Intern at Amazon's Alexa and contributed to building components for the model-releasing infrastructure of Alexa's Automatic Speech Recognition.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any opportunities or questions for me.
